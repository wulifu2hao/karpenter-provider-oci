| settings.batchIdleDuration | string | `"1s"` | The maximum amount of time with no new ending pods that if exceeded ends the current batching window. If pods arrive faster than this time, the batching window will be extended up to the maxDuration. If they arrive slower, the pods will be batched separately. |
| settings.batchMaxDuration | string | `"10s"` | The maximum length of a batch window. The longer this is, the more pods we can consider for provisioning at one time which usually results in fewer but larger nodes. |

More information here https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/#feature-gates-for-alpha-or-beta-features |

| settings.featureGates.spotToSpotConsolidation | bool | `false` | spotToSpotConsolidation is ALPHA and is disabled by default. Setting this to true will enable spot replacement consolidation for both single and multi-node consolidation. |
| settings.featureGates.staticCapacity | bool | `false` | staticCapacity is ALPHA and is disabled by default. Setting this to true will enable staticCapacity. |
| settings.instanceTypeMetaConfigMapName | string | `"oci-instance-type-meta"` | ConfigMap that stores oci-compute price and shape information |
| settings.ipFamilies | list | `["IPv4"]` | by default only IPv4, add IPv6 in needed |

| settings.rateLimiter.burstRead | int | `0` | Read burst for the OCI client-side rate limiter. 0 uses the built-in default. |

| settings.unavailableOfferingsTTLSeconds | int | `180` | How long, in seconds, an offering observed to be out of host capacity is treated as unavailable before Karpenter retries it. Lower values retry exhausted offerings sooner; higher values reduce repeated launch attempts (and OCI throttling) against capacity that is unlikely to recover quickly. Set to 0 to disable the unavailable-offerings cache entirely, in which case offerings are never marked unavailable and Karpenter does not route around capacity-exhausted offerings. |
| settings.vcnCompartmentId | string | `""` | [required] Cluster's VCN compartment OCID. |
| settings.vmMemoryOverhead.baseMiB | int | `600` | Fixed part of the overhead, in MiB. |

| settings.vmMemoryOverhead.percent | int | `0` | An alternative way of expressing the overhead, as a fraction of declared memory (0.075 == 7.5%). 0 means unused. The larger of the two forms is applied, so setting this can only make the estimate more conservative, never less. |
| strategy | object | `{"rollingUpdate":{"maxUnavailable":1}}` | Strategy for updating the pod. |
| terminationGracePeriodSeconds | string | `nil` | Override the default termination grace period for the pod. |
| tolerations | list | `[{"key":"CriticalAddonsOnly","operator":"Exists"}]` | Tolerations to allow the pod to be scheduled to nodes with taints. |
| topologySpreadConstraints | list | `[{"maxSkew":1,"topologyKey":"topology.kubernetes.io/zone","whenUnsatisfiable":"DoNotSchedule"}]` | Topology spread constraints to increase the controller resilience by distributing pods across the cluster zones. If an explicit label selector is not provided one will be created from the pod selector labels. |
| volumeMounts | list | `[]` | Additional volume mounts on the controller container. |
| volumes | list | `[]` | Additional volumes on the controller Deployment. |
