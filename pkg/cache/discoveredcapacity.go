// DiscoveredCapacity stores memory capacity actually observed on registered nodes, so that later
// launches of the same instance type and image are modelled from measurement rather than estimate.
//
// Karpenter must predict a node's capacity before the node exists. When that prediction is too
// high the pod that triggered the launch does not fit, stays pending, and — because nothing
// compares the prediction against the node it produced — the identical launch repeats. Recording
// what a node actually reported closes that loop: the estimate then only governs the first launch
// of a given combination.
