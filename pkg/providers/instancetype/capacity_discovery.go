// be a candidate while no longer being the one its shape would now select, and its measurement is

// discoveredCapacityCacheKey identifies an instance type together with the images it could boot.
//
// Shape and image are an empirical grouping, not a documented OCI contract. Oracle publishes a
// shape's allocated memory and image/shape compatibility, but not the memory a guest ends up
// seeing. The closest it comes is the Dedicated VM Host table, which does carry a "usable memory"
// column and attributes the shortfall to "the need to reserve OCPUs and memory for hypervisor
// use" - there is no equivalent column for the ordinary VM shapes this models:
// https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/computeshapes.htm
//
// So other factors - host generation, firmware, hypervisor version - may also move the figure.
// The grouping does not have to be exact to be useful: Record keeps the smallest value observed
// for a key, so if several host variants share one, the model converges on the least roomy of
// them. A coarse key costs a little capacity; it does not cost correctness.
//
// The instance type name already encodes shape, OCPU, memory and CPU baseline, so for flexible
// shapes it distinguishes configurations without further work.
//
// The image half hashes the whole candidate list rather than a single resolved image, so the key
// can be computed while scheduling without asking OCI which image a shape would get. The hash is
// order-sensitive on purpose: image selection walks the sorted candidates and takes the first
// compatible one, so a reordered list can select a different image and must not reuse the same
// entry.
